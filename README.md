# Flachen Taschen and xbox 360 kinnect

This project was created using the Api from the [flaschen tashen Api](https://github.com/hzeller/flaschen-taschen). The server portion was used to send the Data over to the LED display. As for the client only an instance of flaschen tashen was used to be able to set the pixels to the color that we wished to set it to. Then send it off to the server. Used glut and opengl to get the video information off of the xbox kinect. Would take current frames from the xbox kinect, grab x amount of pixels colors that would fit on our display, and set this to our display. will work with any size constraints.
