#Flachen Taschen and xbox 360 kinnect

This is using the flaschen taschen project for a display with the dimmensions
of w:35 x h:30. From the Flaschen Taschen API, primarily the udpFlaschenT.. was used to send the udp packets to the display. Open kinnect, Opengl and glut was used to for library to grab and recieve the information from the kinect. Primary grab the pixels based on the constraints on the kinect w x h dimensions and set the pixels to that color from the pixel.
